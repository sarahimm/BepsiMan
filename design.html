            Welcome to the adventures of our copyright friendly soda mascot, Bepsi Man! 
            Bepsi man requires the power of Bepsi to sustain himself, so if he ever runs out of Bepsi, thats curtains.
            Bepsi man can see how much Bepsi he needs by looking in the corner of the screen, there should be a helpful 
            meter. Make sure the meter doesn't run out! As Bepsi Man runs through the streets, you can make Bepsi man jump to help him collect 
            Bepsi. You don't control how fast Bepsi man runs or in what direction, so make sure you try to collect every last can of Bepsi 
            because you never know when the next time you'll have the chance will be!
